# üçî Safka Online üçî

### What is this?

This is a monorepo for the [Safka Online](https://safka.online/) project which archives the Juhannuskukkula's Safka canteen's menu, allows it to be queried from an [API](https://api.safka.online/v1/menu), and makes it more accessible to read through our homepage.

### Running and stopping containers

An extremely small script was made to reduce some typing while stopping and starting containers.
Usage is dead-simple: `./mgr <run|stop> [dev]`
  where: **run|stop** runs or stops, and **dev** can be used for either run|stop to use docker-compose.dev.yml instead, which doesn't start or automate nginx.
